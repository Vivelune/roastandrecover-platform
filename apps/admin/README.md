# 🚀 Commerce OS  
**A Multi-Tenant Business Operating System for Real Brands**

Commerce OS is a production-grade platform designed to run **multiple businesses, stores, and workflows from a single system** — the same way companies like Shopify, Stripe, and Notion power thousands of brands.

This is not a demo project.  
This is **live business infrastructure** currently running real companies.

---

## 🌍 What This Is

Commerce OS is a unified admin and automation platform that allows multiple companies to:

- Manage products, orders, and customers  
- Run automated workflows  
- Track revenue and business metrics  
- Control user access by company  
- Integrate AI, email, payments, and APIs  
- Scale without rebuilding their backend  

Everything runs inside one secure, scalable system.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Most dashboards are:
- Hardcoded  
- Single-tenant  
- UI-only  
- Not connected to real business logic  

Commerce OS was built to solve a real problem:  
Running **multiple brands and SaaS products from one backend** without chaos.

So I built a system that acts as a **Business Operating System**.

## 🧬 Multi-Tenant Architecture

Each business gets:
- Its own data  
- Its own users  
- Its own workflows  
- Its own branding  
- Its own revenue  

But everything runs on one shared, scalable system.

This is how real SaaS platforms are built.

The system is live and running here:
